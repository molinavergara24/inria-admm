abstract="In a recent paper [2], we prove an abstract existence result for the Coulomb friction problem in discrete time. This problem must be solved at each time step when performing a simulation of the dynamics of a mechanical system involving unilateral contact and Coulomb friction (expressed here at the level of velocities). In this paper, we only recall this result and the gist of its proof and then give an overview of its range of applicability to show the power of our existence criterion. By considering several mechanical systems (Painlev{\'e}'s example, granular material on a plan or in a drum) and several particular cases (cases with no moving external objects, cases without friction), we demonstrate the broad range of use-cases to which the criterion can be applied by pure abstract reasoning, without any computations. We also show counter-examples where the criterion does not apply. We then turn to more complicated situations where the existence result cannot be used trivially, and discuss the computational methods that are available to check the criterion in practice using optimization software. It turns out that in suffices to solve a linear program (LP) when the problem is bi-dimensional, and a second order cone program (SOCP) when the problem is tri-dimensional.",

abstract="The alternating direction method is one of the attractive approaches for solving linearly constrained separate monotone variational inequalities. Experience on applications has shown that the number of iterations depends significantly on the penalty parameter for the system of linear constraint equations. While the penalty parameter is a constant in the original method, in this paper we present a modified alternating direction method that adjusts the penalty parameter per iteration based on the iterate message. Preliminary numerical tests show that the self-adaptive adjustment technique is effective in practice.",

abstract="In this paper, we focus on a useful modification of the decomposition method by He et al. (Ref. 1). Experience on applications has shown that the number of iterations of the original method depends significantly on the penalty parameter. The main contribution of our method is that we allow the penalty parameter to vary automatically according to some self-adaptive rules. As our numerical simulations indicate, the modified method is more flexible and efficient in practice. A detailed convergence analysis of our method is also included.",
